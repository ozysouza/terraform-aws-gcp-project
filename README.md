**Project title:**

*Deployment of a Private Communication in a MultiCloud Environment (AWS and GCP) 100% Automated Using Terraform*

**Project description:**

In another project based on a real-world scenario, I acted as a Cloud Specialist in a company that used Google Cloud and AWS services in separate architectures.

The company decided to interconnect the two completely private architectures using the Virtual Private Gateway, Customer Gateway, Cloud Routers, and Cloud VPN, among other services.

However, they needed it in production in a week. So, once GCP and AWS accounts were created, to save time, I decided to deploy it in a 100% automated way using Terraform.

**Executing Terraform:**

terraform init

terraform apply

terraform destroy
